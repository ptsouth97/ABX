\section{Assessment Tools and Results}
A variety of tools were used to assess Emanuel’s present level of functioning.  Those tools and their results are reported below.  

	\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Vineland II
	\item PDDBI
	\item Ecological Inventory and Routine Analysis
	\item Parent Interview
	\end{enumerate}

	%\subsection{Vineland II}
	%The Vineland II is a measure of personal and social skills needed for everyday living in the domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills, and maladaptive behavior. \momname\ served as the informant. 


	\subsection{PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI)}
	The PDDBI is a clinical tool that is age-standardized on children aged 1 year 6 months to 18 years diagnosed with any of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders identified in the DSM-IV.  \momname\ completed the Parent Rating form and \BCBA\ completed the teacher form.  Cluster Score Summary Tables for both Raters are included below.

\section{Recommended Level of Support}
\clientfirstname\ demonstrates deficits in multiple domains, most notably socialization, adaptive, communication, emotional and self-regulation, age appropriate cognitive skills, and language skills such as reporting internal states in self and others, identifying others’ perspectives in social conflicts and self-advocacy.  These are significant challenges that impact \clientfirstname's day-to-day life.  The focus of \clientfirstname’s therapy program is to address skills in the following domains:  (a) intermediate social skills (b) self-monitoring and self-regulation (c) adaptive skills (d) intermediate communication skills and (e) cognitive skills. 

\section{Hours of ABA Each Week}

	\begin{tabular}{|l||l|} 
		\hline
		\textbf{By BCBA or BCBA-D} & \BCBAhours\ hours\\

	\end{tabular}

\section{ABA Techniques}
Applied Behavior Analysis techniques used to teach skill acquisition, fluency, generalization, and maintenance of the below treatment goals and objectives include: (a) clear instruction, (b) probe, (c) prompts and errorless learning, (d) stimulus transfer procedures using a constant time delay of 2-5 seconds depending on target skill, (e) differential reinforcement of successive approximations, (f) extinction of skills previously mastered, (g) behavioral momentum, (h) multiple antecedent based interventions including: a visual schedule, timer, priming, choices, and using highly preferred stimuli. In addition, Emanuel benefits from implementation of visual schedules and visual supports for self-monitoring of objectives.  These are introduced, taught, and faded to independence through shaping, extinction, and differential reinforcement techniques. 

\section{Coordination of Care}
There are no other related services at this time.

\section{Parental Involvement}
Parental involvement is crucial to a successful home ABA program since the parents will be interacting with the child for a much greater percentage of time.  Ongoing parental communication will be conducted to ensure that \clientfirstname’s parents are informed of his progress and any need for adjustments in the program.  For applicable goals, parents will be trained to implement procedures in the absence of the therapist to ensure fidelity across people and settings.  His parents will also be invited to attend ongoing ABA classes provided by ABX Solutions.

\section{Discharge Criteria and Transition Plan}
Transition:  Patient will have a systematic drop in the number of house he receives from in 10\%-20\% intervals of duration of hours then move to consultant weekly visits to support maintenance and parent coaching. \clientfirstname will begin the transition plan when he has less than a 6-month developmental delay in adaptive, socialization, and communication domains for six consecutive months.  

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \clientfirstname\ will use communication skills to answer questions, gain information, and interact with peers appropriately across all environments and people.
	\item \clientfirstname\ will develop at least one friendship outside of school that he is able to maintain independently.
	\item \clientfirstname\ will learn replacement strategies for his sensory needs and will have no problem behavior in home or public for a six month period.
	\end{enumerate}

Should any of the following circumstances become evident during the treatment plan period, services will be terminated and referral to another provider will be issued: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of adherence to attendance policy and/or to recommended therapeutic level of care. 
	\item Lack of adherence to stated parent goals and objectives. 
	\item Demonstration of continued pattern of actions that are counter-therapeutic.
	\item Use of non-evidence-based therapeutic practices. 
	\item Behavioral concerns are outside the scope of the consultant’s expertise. 
	\item Unwelcome, unsafe, or unclean environment for therapeutic services. 
	\end{itemize}
